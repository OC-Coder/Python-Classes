PYTHON CLASS 2 EXERCISES:

FUNCTIONS:

1. Write a function that takes a a numerical grade (0-100) as input and returns (not prints) a
letter grade (A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, etc.).

2. Write functions that convert from (a) Fahrenheit to Celcius, (b) Celcius to Fahrenheit,
(c) Fahrenheit to Kelvin, and (d) Kelvin to Fahrenheit.  Then, try doing (c) and (d) again, 
except this time having (c) call (a) and (d) call (b) as part of how they calculate the conversion.

LOOPS:

3. Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns how many even numbers are in that list.  
Then write a function that takes a list and prints out how many odd numbers are in that list.  
The second function must call the first function.

4. Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the largest number.  Then write a
function that returns the smallest number.  Finally, write a function that returns the mean (average).

5. Write a function that takes two lists of numbers of the same length and returns a list of the sums
of the corresponding elements of each list.  For example, [1,2,3] and [4,5,6] would produce [5,7,9].
Then do this for subtraction, multiplication, and division.

6. Write a function that takes two lists of numbers of the same length and returns the sum of the
products of corresponding elements.  For example, [1,2,3] and [4,5,6] would produce 1x4 + 2x5 + 3x6 = 32.

7. Write a function that takes a list of strings and returns out a "sentence" of those strings by
concatenating all of them with spaces in between.  For example, ["Hello","World","!"] would produce
"Hello World !".

8. Do numbers 3 through 7 with while loops instead of for loops.

9. Write a function that takes a list of numbers and keeps increasing each element of that list by 1
until all elements are greater than 9000, returning the result.  For example, [1,2,3] would produce
[9001, 9002, 9003].  Do this with a while loop and a for loop, and a function from an earlier exercise.
You'll have to copy the code from the previous exercise into your code for this exercise in order for
it to run.

CHALLENGE: These are for next class; we haven't gone over the concepts yet, so there are no solutions

10. Write two functions that do the same as exercise 5 for addition and multiplication, except with a
list of lists.  For example, for addition, an input of [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9] ] returns [12, 15, 18],
while for multiplication, [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9] ] returns [28, 80, 162].

11. Write a function that takes in a number n and finds all of the primes less than n.
