Syntax, Variables, and Basic Operations:

1. Write a program that asks for the user’s name, and then wishes them a happy birthday
using their name.

2. Write a program that takes the temperature in Fahrenheit as input, and prints the
temperature in Celsius and the temperature in Kelvin.  If you don’t know the equations,
look them up online. 

3. Write a program that takes two numbers as input, and prints “True” if the first is
larger than the second and their sum is divisible by either 2 or 3, and “False” otherwise.

4. Write a program that takes the number of seconds as input, and then converts that to
minutes and seconds (for example, 102->1 min, 42 sec) and prints the result.  Also, if
you want, convert it to hours, minutes, and seconds.  

If, Else, and Else-If (Elif):

5. Write a program that takes a number as input and prints out whether it is even and whether
it is divisible by 3. 

6. Write a four-function calculator program that takes in a number, an operation (“+”, “-“,
“x”, or “/”), and then a second number, and prints out the result.

7. Write a program that takes a number as input and prints out whether that year is a leap year.
Leap years occur on every year that is a multiple of 400, as well as years that are multiples of
4 but not multiples of 100.

8. Write a program that plays a game of rock-paper-scissors with the user, with the program always
choosing rock.  Have the program print out both its choice and the player’s choice, as well as who
wins.  Have it insult the player and make them lose if they enter in an invalid choice. 

9. Write a text-based choose-your-own-adventure game.  (No solution provided.  Be creative!)
